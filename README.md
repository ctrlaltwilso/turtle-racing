# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

A simple Python game built with the `turtle` library where players bet on which turtle will win a race!

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. When you run the game, you'll be prompted in the console to **bet on a turtle color**:
   - `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, or `purple`.

2. Once you've placed your bet, all turtles will race **from left to right** across the screen at **random speeds**.

3. When the race ends, the **winning turtle's color** is announced in the console — and you'll see whether your prediction was correct!

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- The `turtle` module (comes with the Python standard library — no need to install anything extra)
